# Patched Sur Patches

Along with the release of Patched Sur v0.2.0, I've switched to my own patch repo instead of using the micropatcher. This organizes everything into a way that I understand and can work with providing the best experience and stability with Patched Sur.

A lot of this code is still directly from BarryKN's micropatcher, so credits to him for making a lot of this.

You shouldn't need this repo, but if you want to explore its contents, go right ahead.
